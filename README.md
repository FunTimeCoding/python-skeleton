# Python Skeleton

To run the program from the **bin** directory, export **PYTHONPATH** first.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
export PYTHONPATH=.

To speed up the typing you can also **source** this script.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
source env.sh
```

## Testing

Install nosetests

```sh
#!/bin/sh
pip3 install nose
```

Run tests

```sh
#!/bin/sh

```
