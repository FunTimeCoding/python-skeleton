# Python Skeleton

To run the program from the **bin** directory, export **PYTHONPATH** first.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

To speed up the typing you can also run this script.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
./env.sh
```

## Testing

Install nosetests

```sh
#!/bin/sh
easy_install nose
```

Run tests

```sh
#!/bin/sh
nosetsts
```
